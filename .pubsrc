# Here you can define the color theme used by pubs, if enabled in the

# https://github.com/pubs/pubs/blob/master/extra/themes.md

# Available colors are: 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'purple',
# 'cyan', and 'grey'. Bold colors are available by prefixing 'b' in front of
# the color name ('bblack', 'bred', etc.), italic colors by prefixing 'i',
# and bold italic by prefixing 'bi'. Finally, 'bold', 'italic' and
# 'bolditalic' can be used to apply formatting without changing the color.
# For no color, use an empty string ''

[[git]]
# The git plugin will commit changes to the repository in a git repository
# created at the root of the pubs directory. All detected changes will be
# commited every time a change is made by a pubs command.
# The plugin also propose the `pubs git` subcommand, to directly send git
# commands to the pubs repository. Therefore, `pubs git status` is equivalent
# to `git -C <pubsdir> status`, with the `-C` flag instructing
# to invoke git as if the current directory was <pubsdir>. Note that a
# limitation of the subcommand is that you cannot use git commands with the
# `-c` option (pubs will interpret it first.)
# if False, will display git output when automatic commit are made.
# Invocation of `pubs git` will always have output displayed.

# if True, color will be conserved from git output (this add `-c color:always`
